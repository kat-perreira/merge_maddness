a repo to practice clone, push, pull and handle merge conflicts.

A safe space to fuck up the repository, make all the mistakes with no consequences.

Share this with anyone who wants a repo to practice with.

Word of advice. Pull first before you push.

House rules:
Im writing something here in local
now im going to push thisz

- Communicate
- Leave nice comments on PRs
- Be kind

## What you can do to practice

- Create a branch, write a poem with words that rhyme with git or anything in File 1, submit a PR

- Pass notes to each other in file 2, merge directly into main. Its the wild west in here.

- Write whatever you want in file 3
