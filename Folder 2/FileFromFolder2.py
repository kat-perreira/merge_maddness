# Heeeey everyone!
# It is raining in Atlanta
# What is the weather in Seattle?

#Dear Genie's diary,
# Well same here, raining in Seattle
#What did you do today?


# Dear Genie's Diary,

# It took me 3 hours to get out of bed and go to Target.
# But I saw this cute show called Alice in Paris.
# And now I want to go to Paris and eat.
# What did you do?

#Dear Genie's Diary,
# Kat and I ate breakfast this morning
#Then came to her house where I have been trying to understand this Git and Github stuff
#Then she tried to kill me with her hot sauce

# Dear Genies diary,
# If by kill you mean bestowed upon you an experience of euphoria where you got to enjoy the absolute joy of eating
# glorious hot sauce then....you're welcome :)
