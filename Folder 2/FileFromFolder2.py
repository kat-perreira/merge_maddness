# Dear Genie's Diary,

# It took me 3 hours to get out of bed and go to Target.
# But I saw this cute show called Alice in Paris.
# And now I want to go to Paris and eat.
# What did you do?

#Dear Genie's Diary,
# Kat and I ate breakfast this morning
#Then came to her house where I have been trying to understand this Git and Github stuff
#Then she tried to kill me with her hot sauce

# Dear Genies diary,
# If by kill you mean bestowed upon you an experience of euphoria where you got to enjoy the absolute joy of eating
# glorious hot sauce then....you're welcome :)

# Dear Genie's Diary,

# Oh my! What an experience. Hot sauce is the beeeeest. 
# I bet it was yummy!
# What sauce was it?

#Dear Genie's Diary, 
#Hahaha that was death in the mouth
#Yes hot sauce is soooo awesome but when you tummy is making noise after, it makes me wonder
